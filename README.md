# CS7GV5-Assignment-2-Hierarchical-Creatures

• Design and animate two hierarchical 3D creatures, using simple
primitives such as blocks, spheres and cylinders. One creature can have a simple 3-bone (with
two links) structure, with a 1-1 relationship between each parent-child. The second creature
should be more complex, with at least 5 bones and at least one 1-many relationship (
torso with two independent links).

• Animate the creatures using both forward and inverse kinematics (IK). Analytical
solutions to IK are the most straightforward and can be used for the simple model. For the
more complex creature, CCD was investigated. 

C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.

The "include" and "lib" folder were not contained, you can find that from my other project.
